- Front end is mostly done
  - Nav Bar works and should be animating correctly
  - still using placeholders for everything

HTML and CSS classes elements are named with [Block Element Modifier](http://getbem.com/introduction/) (BEM) notation.

## Cloning instructions

To clone the repo, use your preferred SCM(git in the below example).
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saseconnect/sasecasts.git
```

If you intend on modifying the SCSS files you will need a compiler for it. If you don't have a compiler for it, several options are listed below.
  - VS Code has an extension for it called [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass)
  - [Koala](http://koala-app.com/) is a free app.
  - the offical [Sass page](https://sass-lang.com/install) also provides several options
